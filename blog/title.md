summary: A little story of my journey from an introduction to web development to
  my current level
---
Hey, there! Welcome to my site/blog and forgive me if I happen to start ranting (I could be lost in my head among the memories). I'm Favour and I am an intermediate level developer. I started writing code in June 2019 and I started with HTML and CSS. It was a little challenging at first but I sat in the class and eventually understood. Let me back up a little. I started learning code during my industrial training period in my fourth year in the university. I had already told myself that I would not learn to code - I thought it was too difficult!. I went to an IT school here in Enugu State, Nigeria - Aptech to be precise and I was amazed that all I needed was a great learning environment and a good teacher to set me on the right path. I quickly picked up on my learning and before long I started teaching my class mates whatever it was that we'd handled in class that they didn't understand. It was pretty much a rad experience learning in the early days.

> *I chose to stay inspired and wrote code everyday and every time I could! Whatever I didn't understand I read books, cased sites on Google and watched YouTube videos till I got satisfactory answers.*

**What I faced while learning**

I had to be very intentional and tried to stay motivated while I was learning the basics. I got to understand that the basics were so important that if I missed it I would have a very  shaky foundation. It got hard on days when I had no idea what the problem with my code was and also couldn't understand what the solution I sometimes found meant. At this juncture my teachers at Aptech were instrumental to helping me understand whatever it was that I needed to. 

A word of advice I'd like to give anyone who wants to start out on this journey, take a deep breath and don't rush. You'll get there and you'd be happy you took your time learning.

Stay frosty guys. See you in the funny papers!
